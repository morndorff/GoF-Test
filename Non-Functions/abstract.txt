We consider the problem of changepoint detection where at each observation a sample from a distribution is observed.   The changepoint is detected using a statistic based on differences in the empirical CDF. These differences are then transformed into the wavelet domain ...   while incorporating wavelet shrinkage. This shrinkage enables the test to retain good power in detecting changepoints.  The approach used is nonparametic, using no particular distributional assumptions on the in-control process. Simulation studies show that this approach has good power in a variety of situations.

The process is monitored for changepoints using a statistic based on differences in the empirical CDF. These differences are then transformed to the wavelet domain, providing dimension reduction . This dimension reduction allows the test to have good power in detection change points. The approach used is nonparametric, requiring to no particular distributional assumptions on the in-control process. A real-time algorithm is proposed for changepoint monitoring. Simulation studies show that this approach has good power in a variety of situation.
